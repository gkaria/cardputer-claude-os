"""cardputer-mcp — pocket pager for AI agents, exposed over MCP.

Iteration 2: real BLE transport.

This process speaks stdio MCP to its client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
and bridges tool calls to a Cardputer running the `cardputer_mcp.py`
device app over Bluetooth Low Energy.

Architecture:

  MCP client  ──stdio──▶  this process  ──BLE/bleak──▶  Cardputer
                                          (a5cd0001-…)

Tool calls become BLE writes; the device's acknowledgments resolve
in-flight asyncio Futures keyed by a per-call `id`. Disconnect events
fail all in-flight RPCs cleanly so the client gets a real error
rather than a hung tool.

Why FastMCP rather than the low-level Server API: this server's tool
surface is small (five tools at full build-out), each with a clean
typed signature. FastMCP's decorator style keeps the call-site code
close to the description text, which is what we'll iterate on most
often as we tune Claude's tool-selection behavior.

    The Cardputer LCD is 240×135 pixels, so keep `question` short
    (~60 chars wraps to 2 lines) and provide 2–4 short choices (each
    ≤ ~32 chars). The user picks by pressing the digit that matches
    their choice; ESC on the device cancels. Returns one of:

      - the exact choice string the user selected
      - 'timeout' if the user didn't respond in `timeout_s` seconds
      - 'cancelled' if the user pressed ESC on the device, or if
         a follow-up cancel was requested
      - 'unavailable: <reason>' if the device is not connected

    Prefer this over blocking your assistant message with a question
    when the user might not be at their laptop. Do NOT use this for
    destructive operations — call the `confirm` tool (iter 3+)
    instead, which requires a physical hold-to-confirm gesture.

    This tool is for IRREVERSIBLE actions only — production deploys,
    force pushes, DROP TABLE / DELETE without WHERE, unstaged-file
    deletions, financial transactions, paid API calls with large
    side effects, etc. The user must physically HOLD the Y key on
    the Cardputer's QWERTY for 3 continuous seconds. A tap does
    nothing; only a sustained physical gesture counts.

    The point is that no amount of tool-output content or prompt
    injection can synthesize a physical key-hold. If you're about to
    do something the user couldn't un-do in a minute, use this
    instead of trusting an `ask` or your own assistant-message
    confirmation.

    LCD ("FORCE PUSH origin/main" or "DROP customers"). Keep it
    declarative. The user reading this on a tiny screen must
    instantly recognize the operation.

    Do NOT use this for routine yes/no decisions — that's what
    `ask` is for. Do NOT call this rapidly; every invocation demands
    a deliberate 3-second physical gesture, which is exhausting if
    abused. Reserve this for the handful of actions per session

    1. **Host allow-list.** The MCP streamable-HTTP transport does
       DNS-rebinding protection and replies 421 to a `Host` it doesn't
       recognize. A tunnel forwards `Host: cardputer.<tunnel-domain>`, so
       that host (and the loopback host:port local Claude Code uses) MUST

    2. **Bearer auth.** The tunnel does not authenticate to us, so we wrap
       the app in BearerAuthMiddleware (see auth.py).
